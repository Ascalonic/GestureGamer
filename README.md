# GestureGamer
A basic gesture based gaming API demo based on OpenCV

GestureGamer is a little internal project Ascalonic built, some 2 years ago using Python and Visual Basic.

You gestures before a single camera are tracked by the GestureGamer client and then the data is available in the internal port 8080 for
other applications to use. In this case, we build a basic 3D plane than moves (rotates) using the data fed from the server.

The server was written in Python using OpenCV and the client was written in VB (OpenTK - OpenGL).
